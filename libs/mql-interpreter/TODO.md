# TODO for MQL Interpreter

The following tasks outline future work required to develop a functional MQL4/5 interpreter.

- [ ] Implement a lexical analyzer to tokenize MQL source code
- [ ] Build a parser that generates an AST from tokens
- [ ] Design an execution engine capable of evaluating the AST
- [ ] Map essential MQL built‑in functions (e.g. `OrderSend`, `iMA`) to JavaScript implementations
- [ ] Provide a command‑line interface for running MQL scripts within Node.js
- [ ] Create automated tests covering the lexer, parser and runtime
- [ ] Document the interpreter architecture and usage examples
